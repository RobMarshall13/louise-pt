 # Personal Trainer Website by Robert Marshall #

The website is required for a personal trainer called Louise Barbuti.

The purpose of the website is to introduce poteneial clients to Louise and her skillset. The site is also designed to encourage potential clients to make contact with Louise. The site also needed to reflect the alternative nature

I have used seven pages to achieve this with each page containing a button in a prominent position which links to the contact page. The contact page contains a contact form along with easily identifiable contact information for Louise. Each page also contains links in the footer to the different certifying bodies to which Louise is registered making it easy for the user to either contact Louise or check out her credentials.

For development purposes the site uses some sample content and images at this time.

## Functionality/Technologies ##

#### Layout ####
The site links to Bootstrap 3.3.7 and makes some use of the grid system although some of the Bootstrap CSS has been overwritten during the development process.
#### Social Media ####
The site also links to font awesome to make use of the social media icons which as yet do not link anywhere as the client has not yet provided this information.
#### Navigation Bar ####
The code for the navigation bar was initially taken directly from the previous whiskey Drop project which also utilises Bootstrap. The navigation bar has then been restyled with css to make it fit better with the overall style of this webpage.
#### Videos ####
The videos are embedded using the code directly from YouTube and then some styles and sizes are changed to make them react to different screen sizes.

## Overall Style and Format ##

I have chosen to utilise full screen background images across all pages of the site to apply an alternative styling to that seen across most personal trainer websites.
